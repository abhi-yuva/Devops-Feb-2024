### How to Run your Job from GIT Code
- If you want to run your Job from GIT-Hub you have to create a file called **Jenkinsfile**
- Inside of jenkins file you have to specify what you want to perform
- We have 2 types of Scripts for Jenkinsfile
    1. Scripted Pipeline
    2. Declarative Pipeline
- Syntax of Declarative Pipeline is as follows
```Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any # if you want to execute in particualr agent

    stages{ #All your stages if your pipeline is wrapped inside of this block
        stage(Stage 1) { # This is individual to the stage
            steps{ # what ever you want to run inside of your Stage you have to sepcify in #this block
                echo "This is my First Stage"
                sh 'pwd'
                sh 'ls'
                sh 'whoami'

            }
        }

        stage(Stage 2) { # This is individual to the stage
            steps{
                echo "This is my Second Stage"

            }
        }
    }

    post { #Executing your Post Build Actions
        
    }

}
