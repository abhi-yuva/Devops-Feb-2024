### How to Schedule a Job in Jenkins
- In jenkins to Schedule a Job we have 2 options
    1. **Build Periodically**
    2. **Pool SCM**

### **Build Periodically**
- With this option we can execute our jobs at a particualr period of time regularly.
- We have to put our data in the form of CornJob. It will have 5 option where you can choose as per your requirement.
- To do this, go to this [website](https://crontab.guru/) and then choose accordingly if you want to refer and confirm
- The 5 options are
    ```
    * * * * * 
    ```
    1. Minute - 0-59 Allowed
    2. Hours - 0-23 Allowed
    3. Day (Month) - 1-31
    4. Month - 1-12/JAN-DEC
    5. Day (Week) - 0-6/SUN-SAT

- In Jenkins the cornjob will be taken in Universal time zone.

### **Pool SCM**
- This is also similar to the Build Periodically option but the difference is that it will fetch the latest changes from the GitHub at particualr period of time
- To select this in configuration we have option called **pool SCM**
