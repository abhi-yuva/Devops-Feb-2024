- For every job, a new workspcae will be created under jobs in the default folder of jenkins
```
/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/<workspace-name>
```
- Inside of every workspace we have the following data
```
root@ip-172-31-21-172:/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/my-first-jenkins-job# ls
builds  config.xml  nextBuildNumber
```
- **Builds** - Builds are those which are already executed in your jenkins workspace. It will contain all the list of build it executed. Untill you choose option of **discard old builds** to  remove builds before execution from configuration. <br>

    * Contents inside of the builds
    ```
    root@ip-172-31-21-172:/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/my-first-jenkins-job/builds# ls
    1  2  legacyIds  permalinks
    ```
    - 1 & 2 ... are the build numbers
    - legacyIds - id related to the builds
    - permalinks - It will show you how many builds are successful, failure, stable & unstable with count

- **config.xml** - This config.xml will contain exactly what you have configured from your Jenkins Console
Each and every information and options you choose in your jenkins job is a copy of this config.xml file. If you wish you can modify it from this file also, but it is not recommended.
Let's see what we have inside of config.xml file
```
root@ip-172-31-21-172:/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/my-first-jenkins-job# cat config.xml
<?xml version='1.1' encoding='UTF-8'?>
