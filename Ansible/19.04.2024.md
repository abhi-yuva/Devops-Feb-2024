Ansible Cont...

- Basically we will be using **Service** module to enable or start or restart our services.
- These steps we have to write in all the tasks every time.
- when you are using the similar package it is not required to write multiple times
- But if we try to install any another softwares we have to write these services steps for all the tasks
- Instead there is an otpion called **Notifier** where we can use this format to just initmate to the handler that I want to use this task
- Check this [Doucmentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_handlers.html) for Handlers.
- Handlers can be notified in 3 ways
    1. Notify
    2. Multiple Notifiers
    3. Listeners
- See this playbook for how to write handlers & Notifiers
