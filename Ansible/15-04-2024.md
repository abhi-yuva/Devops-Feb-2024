## Ansible Cont...

- Today we are going to execute our playbooks in different flavours of OS
- We will be creating an EC2 Server with Redhat OS
- Just follow the class recording to create Redhat OS EC2 Machine
- After EC2 machine is ready make sure we have copied SSH keys
- Once Server is ready we will be chaning our inventory file
- As here it is trying to install our softwares in different OS families we have to differentiate it with the help of variables in inventory file
```
[ubuntu]
172.31.25.221

[redhat]
172.31.30.204
```
- Now we have to pass this in our playbook while creating with the help of **Ansible Facts**
- By using Facts we can differentiate OS familiy and can be install softwares accordingly
- Here we have to use When condition to show the difference.
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html) for When Condition
- By combining both ansible facts & When condition we can re-write our playbook like this
```
when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'RedHat'
when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'Debian'
```
