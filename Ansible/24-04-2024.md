## Ansible Cont...

- When you are running any tasks it is better to show what is happening
- Like wise in linux we have an echo to display what is currently running, in the same way we have an module called **Debug** in ansible
- We can use this Debug message to display a message in the task level
- [Official Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html) for Debug Module
- We have 3 options
    1. **msg** - To display any information on the task level
    2. **var** - To display variable values we can use this param with {{ }}
    3. **Verbosity** - It is something like knowing what is happening in deeper

### MSG
- Sample Code to display message in task level in playbook
```
---
- name: Sample Playbook
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    - Name: text message display
      debug:
        msg: appache Installed
      notify:
        - Restart apache
    - name: Install Git
      apt:
        name: git
        state: present
    - Name: text message display
      debug:
        msg: Git Installed
      notify:
        - started

  handlers:
  - name: Restart apache
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
```

### How to use Output of one command in another command
- We have an option called **Register** which will try to store the output of the command what ever it was executed
- The stored information can be used to display or use it as input to the next task or output
- When registring we have to use a variable to store the output value
- That variable can be used as input in some other place
