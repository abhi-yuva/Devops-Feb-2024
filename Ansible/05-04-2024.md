## Ansible Cont ...

### Terminology in Ansible
- **Nodes** - Node is nothing but a Server. All the servere what ever we want to automate our task, we call all those servers as Nodes.
    -    There are 2 types of nodes
        * **Ansible Control Node**:
            - It is the once which will try to manage all the automation activities to be executed in all other servers.
            - Where evere we install Ansbile that we call it as Ansible Server
            - Windows OS doesn't support as Ansible Control Nodes, only **Linux servers** will act as ACN
            - But the clients/Nodes can be of any OS.
            - Python need to be installed in ACN.
        * **Node/Clients**:
            - These are the servers where we call it as Clients/Nodes
            - This also need to have Python installed to support ansible activities
- **Inventory** - It is the place where all our servers information(IP Address) is stored. Based on the data available in Inventory file only ACN will act to execute the tasks
- **Playbook** - Playbook is the file which will have automation steps for all our manuall activities.

- **Ansible Controll Node** will execute the **Playbook** according to the **Inventory Data**
