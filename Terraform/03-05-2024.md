## How to create IAM Role
- Follow Class recording to create IAM Role
- Note down the Access Key & Secrety Access key

## Configure AWS credentials in Terraform
- When you want to create any resources we need to know where you have to create?
- You need to have connectivity between Thirdy Party tool & AWS
- In AWS we have an option called IAM(Identity & Access Management)
- Use the Access keys which was created earlier and follow the below steps
- In provider block we have to pass these values
```
provider "aws" {
    region = "us-west-2"
    access_key = "<your-access-key>"
    secret_key = "<your-secret-key>"
}
```

## How to write Resorce Block for EC2 Creation
- Resource block will contain the actual data which is used to create services in providers
- Before writing this we need to know what are the manual steps that are required to create a service
- Below are the manual steps to create EC2 Machine
    1. Choose AMI
    2. Instance Type
    3. Key-Pair
    4. Security Groups
    5. Volume/Storage
    6. Name of the EC2 Machine
    7. No of Instances to Create
- Now convert all these manual steps into automation in terraform
- Syntax of Resource block is
```
resource "aws_instance" "my-ec2" {
    ami = "ami-0cf2b4e024cdb6960"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    tags = {
      name = "Through Terraform"
    } 
}

```
- After that follow the commands
```
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
```
- Here is the sample plan output
```
$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly   
these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
```
- Then do apply to create resource & it will ask you for confirmation, give yes to create resources
```
terraform apply
```
```
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
```
- Then after creation it will show you ID. Here is sample output
```

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
