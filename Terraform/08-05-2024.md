## How to Reconfigure your Backend Information in Terraform
### Simple Scenario
- Let say you have created backend in remote system instead of storing it in your local system
- Now you want to remove remote state deatils and you want to store it in your local system then you have to reconfigure your initialization
- We have 2 option in terraform to do this
    1. `terraform init -reconfigure` - This is similar to new Inititalization
    2. `terraform init -migrate-state` - Moving the existing data from Remote to Local

## How to use Count Argument
- If you want to create multiple resources with the same name in that case instead of writing multiple resources one for each, you can use `count` argument to specify no of resources to create.
- Here with that you will be using only one resource block but creating multiple resources
- How you have to use count argument is `count = <value>`
- Now in outputs if you want to know values for one attribute for different resources the syntax woulbe be like below
```
output "private-ip" {
  value = ["${<resource>.<resource-name>.*.<resource-output-name>}"]
}

Example:
output "private-ip" {
  value = ["${aws_instance.my-ec2.*.private_ip}"]
}
```

- If you want to differentiate name in terraform you can specify `${count.index}` in tags
- [Refer Here](https://github.com/abhi-yuva/Terraform-Priactice/commit/51a8b2f407030797aba7334a2176bf76d6515ff8) for changes
- All togethere with the changes and after creating resources the output values will be displayed like below
```
$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.my-ec2[0] will be created

## Count variable with Lenght
- Go through video for scenario
- we have a function called `length` where we can calculate the lenght and can be applied in count value
- Syntax as below
```
count = length(<value>)

Ex:
count = lenght(var.environment)
```
- [Refer Here](https://github.com/abhi-yuva/Terraform-Priactice/commit/0638a4d413dea70fe9580c12622e2ae605bab411) for changes 
- If you wish you can modify the name instead of 0,1..
- If you want to display name of the environemtn we can speicfy like below
```
tags = {
    Name = var.environment[count.index]
  }
```
- [Refer Here](https://github.com/abhi-yuva/Terraform-Priactice/commit/8fb317ef5ba5e1fc30566f76374d2eef74d35565) for changes
- The sample output will be as below

```
      + tags_all                             = {
          + "Name" = "dev"
        }

      + tags_all                             = {
