### Terraform Cont...
- Now when ever you are trying to create any resources a State File & Backup File will be created
- But that is upto your local system only, in organization same repo & services are shared by all the group of members. So, we have to maintain the state file in remote place where it will be applicable to all the members
- We have an option called `Backend` in Terraform where we can initialize the State files in remote places
- For this we will be using `S3 Bucket` as an option
- Below are the steps
    1. Create S3 Bucket
    2. Configure Terraform Backend

## How to Create an S3 Bucket
- Manual Steps
    1. Bucket Name
    2. ACL Disabled/Enabled
    3. Bucket Type
    4. Block Public Access
    5. Bucket Versioning
    6. Tags
    7. Encryption
    8. Bucket Key
- [Here is](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket) Official Docmention of S3 Resource
- Sample code to create S3 bucket
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```

- After creating S3 bucket we have change the configuration to create Backend

## How to configure Backend in Terraform
- Here is the confgiration to initialize your backend
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-backend-bucket"
    key = "terraform-backend-bucket/terraform-state-file"
    region = var.location
    
  }
}
```
- After specifying all the deatils your have to initialize it
