- Our scenario is that if you want to create any services or resources in cloud you have to write all the code every time
- which is time waste and not recommended way
- We have an option where we can write the template once and use it many times that option is **Terraform Modules**

## Terraform Modules

- Here is [official Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) of Terraform Modules

- Here is sample example
