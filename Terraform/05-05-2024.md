### Terraform Cont...
- Now when ever any resources are created we are getting outputs. But those are not displayed after executing `terraform apply`
- For that we have an option called `outputs.tf` to specify or to display the outputs after execution
- As the data is already storing in State files but we will not be able to see those data and need to search for that content
- As the state file is stored seperately in organization, every developer will not have access to view it
- So, for that we will be going with Outputs.tf option

### Outpus in Terraform
- Here is syntax of outpus 
```
output "public-ip" {
    value = resource.resource_name.argument-name
  
}
```
- Example outputs as follows
```
output "public-ip" {
    value = aws_instance.my-ec2.public_ip 
}

output "private-ip" {
    value = aws_instance.my-ec2.private_ip
  
}
```

- After creating a resource it will show us like this
```
Outputs:

instance-id = "i-0ee83a9177cf33a06"
private-ip = "172.31.19.182"
public-ip = "52.12.188.235"
```

## Depends on in Terraform
- Simple scenario is you are trying to create an EC2 machine
- Go throught recording video to get more clarity on this scenario
- Dependencies
    1. VPC
    2. Security Group
    3. EC2 Machine
- We have to pass one output value as input to the another resource
- Now as you are trying to create 3 resources it is not recommended to create seperate repository for all the resources
- We have to create all the resources in the same repository and need to use those outpus as inputs
- For that, we have an option in Terraform called `Depends on`
- Where it will try to wait until the other resource is created and will take the output of that resource and will be passed as output to the other resource
- [Official Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) for Depends ON
