### Terraform Cont...
- AS we know Access Key & Secret key are most important we should not expose it to outside
- There is an option to configure it in our local system or in any of the tools like Jenkins/Azure Pipelines with the values so that no need to hardcode the values in the code

## How to Configure AWS in your local system
- Just type `aws cofigure`
- Then it will ask you the below details pass all the detatils
```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [****************NAAH]: <your-access-key>
AWS Secret Access Key [****************95/2]: <>your-secret-key
Default region name [us-west-2]: 
Default output format [None]: 
```
- Now we can remove those secrets from our code.
- Now try to execute the template and see what will happen
- If you were able to create resources after removing the values from our code, then your configuration is success

## Know more about Terraform Statefile & backup File
### Terraform State File
- This file will store the information that is related to the present configuration from our template
- This will have the complete data of all the resources you are going to create
### Terraform State Backup File
- When ever there is a change in the template or in the configuration it will take backup of the current tfstate file and will be stored in tfstate.backup.file

### How to manage Terraform Files
- Basically we are not supposed to maintain all the data in a single file
- we are supposed to divide the content according to the files and store the data seperatley for each file in terraform
- Example of Provider block and Resource Block
- Provider Block Example
```provider.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```
- Resource Block Example
```main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "my-ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0cf2b4e024cdb6960"
  instance_type = "t3.large"


  tags = {
    Name = "Through Terraform"
  }
}
```

### Variables in Terraform
- All arguments in the template sould not be hardcoded
- you have to specify it in variables format
- Sysntax of variable is
```
variable "<variable-Name>" {
  key = value
}
```
- Example
```
variable "image_id" {
  type = string
}
```
- Name of this block is `variables.tf`
- When you are creating the variable you have to reffer your variables in your `tf` files
- The way of refferring the variables is `var.<variable-name>`
```
variable "image"{
    default = "ami-0cf2b4e024cdb6960"
}
resource "aws_instance" "my-ec2"
{
    ami = var.image
}
```
